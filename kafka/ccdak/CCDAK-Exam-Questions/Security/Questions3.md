## Question 21

What is the purpose of the `sasl.mechanism` configuration in Kafka SASL authentication?

- A. To specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication (e.g., PLAIN, SCRAM)
- B. To configure the SASL client and server callbacks for authentication
- C. To set the path to the JAAS configuration file for SASL authentication
- D. To enable or disable SASL authentication in Kafka

**Explanation:**
The `sasl.mechanism` configuration in Kafka is used to specify the SASL mechanism to be used for authentication. SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) is a framework that provides authentication and optional encryption for network protocols. Kafka supports multiple SASL mechanisms, such as PLAIN, SCRAM (Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism), and GSSAPI (Kerberos). The `sasl.mechanism` configuration allows you to choose the specific SASL mechanism that Kafka should use for authentication. For example, setting `sasl.mechanism=PLAIN` configures Kafka to use the PLAIN mechanism, which transmits credentials in plaintext. Setting `sasl.mechanism=SCRAM-SHA-256` configures Kafka to use the SCRAM mechanism with SHA-256 hashing for secure password-based authentication. The available SASL mechanisms depend on the Kafka version and the security libraries installed.

**Answer:** A

## Question 22

What security protocol does Kafka use by default for communication between clients and brokers?

- A. SSL/TLS
- B. SASL_PLAINTEXT
- C. PLAINTEXT
- D. SASL_SSL

**Explanation:**
- B. default, Kafka uses the PLAINTEXT security protocol for communication between clients and brokers. The PLAINTEXT protocol does not provide any encryption or authentication and sends data in plain text over the network. It is the simplest and most basic security protocol in Kafka, offering no security measures out of the box. While PLAINTEXT is the default protocol, it is not recommended for production environments or sensitive data transmission. Instead, it is strongly advised to use more secure protocols like SSL/TLS (SSL) or SASL (SASL_PLAINTEXT or SASL_SSL) to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authentication between clients and brokers.

**Answer:** C

## Question 23

Which security protocol in Kafka provides encryption for data in transit but does not offer authentication?

- A. PLAINTEXT
- B. SASL_PLAINTEXT
- C. SSL
- D. SASL_SSL

**Explanation:**
In Kafka, the SSL security protocol provides encryption for data in transit between clients and brokers but does not offer authentication. When the SSL protocol is used, all the data exchanged between clients and brokers is encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the data. However, SSL alone does not handle authentication of the clients or brokers. It focuses solely on encrypting the communication channel. To achieve authentication in conjunction with encryption, you need to use the SASL_SSL protocol, which combines SSL encryption with SASL authentication. Alternatively, you can use SSL with separate authentication mechanisms like client certificates or Kerberos.

**Answer:** C

## Question 24

Which security protocol in Kafka provides both encryption and authentication for client-broker communication?

- A. PLAINTEXT
- B. SASL_PLAINTEXT
- C. SSL
- D. SASL_SSL

**Explanation:**
The SASL_SSL security protocol in Kafka provides both encryption and authentication for client-broker communication. SASL_SSL combines the benefits of SSL/TLS encryption with SASL authentication mechanisms. When SASL_SSL is used, the data exchanged between clients and brokers is encrypted using SSL/TLS, ensuring confidentiality and integrity. Additionally, SASL authentication is employed to authenticate the clients and brokers. SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) supports various authentication mechanisms, such as PLAIN, SCRAM, and GSSAPI (Kerberos). By using SASL_SSL, you can achieve both encryption and authentication in a single protocol, providing a high level of security for your Kafka cluster.

**Answer:** D
